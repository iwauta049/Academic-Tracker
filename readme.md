# Academic Tracker GUI
### Author: Utaha Iwai (utaha.iwai@ucalgary.ca), Dipti Kumar (dipti.kumar@ucalgary.ca)
This is an academic tracker, where the user is able to input courses they
are taking at the University of Calgary. The user is able to add projects(exam/assignments)
under a course, along with information about the project. The user can then
track their grades, updating their grades after completing projects, and track their grades
based on the weight of the assignment or exam  and how they are doing in the course.

The functionality of the GUI includes showing course information, project information,
as well as the grades of the user under different tabs. If the user withdraws from a course,
they are able to remove it from their dashboard, and can choose to only see courses
in progress in their dashboard. Similarly, users can mark assignments complete and
only choose to see in-progress projects.
